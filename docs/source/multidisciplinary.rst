The multidisciplinary uses of iDaVIE
====================================
iDaVIE, as a data visualisation tool for 3D volumetric data, provides profound insight for a multitude of scientific disciplines. While our focus has been on astronomical data and the included analysis tools are tailored to that domain, the visualisation on its own provides substantial benefit to other disciplines. This includes 3D models of neurological systems constructed from MRI images, 3D models of ice cores constructed from CT scans, and models of a mouse brain assembled from microscope images.
