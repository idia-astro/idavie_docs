Troubleshooting
---------------
In this section we share some useful tips where we found a solution to a known issue:

- Under some circumstances the voice commands stop to work. If this happens we found that the following sequence of actions solves the problem (**NOTE**: this solution has been tested only with Oculus Rift S and on machines where the RealTek Audio driver is installed, we cannot assure it will work for any set up)

  #. take the headset off 
  
  #. make sure the iDaVIE-v Desktop GUI is front and center and no other windows are in front of it
  
  #. use the Windows search function (lower left hand corner - says Type here to search), and type audio
  
  #. open the RealTek Audio Console that will apper after the search
  
  #. check that the Microphone is set to maxium;   toggle <mute> on and then off. Now the mic should be on and ready to receive commands.

  #. close the Audio Console

  #. put the headset back on and use the voice commands as normal.

- If errors are encountered that you can't solve, please:

  #. post and issue on the Github repository
  
  #. make contact with us and send us the log files along with your bug reports. The log files can be found in the directory :literal:`%appdata%/../LocalLow/IDIA/iDaVIE-v`. In order to find this directory using Windows please press :literal:`WIN + R` to open the run dialog, and paste the path directory in to open the folder). 
  
.. WARNING:: Unity only allows for a maximum of two log files to be stored. Therefore, if a problem is encountered with iDaVIE-v is best to copy the log file to a different folder **BEFORE** starting a new iDaVIE-v session otherwise the log file reporting the specific problem encountered will be lost.
