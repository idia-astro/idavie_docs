About iDaVIE
============
iDaVIE (the immersive Data Visualisation Interactive Explorer) was conceived by and is being developed under the custody of the IDIA Visualisation Laboratory.  It provides a Virtual Reality experience for data cube exploration. It visualises 3D data in an interaction 'box', a 3D block (or elongated cube) in VR space which allows the user to extract vital feedback information about the enclosed data (including cumulative statistics and historical data).
