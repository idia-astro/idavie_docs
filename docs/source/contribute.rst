Contributing to the iDaVIE project
==================================

Thank you for your interest in helping iDaVIE become better. We gladly accept contributions from anyone, whether it is a bug fix or a new feature. We present a detailed roadmap for future development directions here: :ref:`future`. Please note that the existing issues on the repository are, except for those noted otherwise, considered minor issues or minor feature requests.

There are several ways to contribute to the development of iDaVIE.

GitHub Discussions
------------------
iDaVIE hosts a `discussion forum <https://github.com/idia-astro/iDaVIE/discussions>`_ on the GitHub repository, where users can ask questions, request support, and discuss various topics related to iDaVIE and its use. Users are encouraged to post answers for other users and interact with our community.

Issues
------
**Create a new issue**
  
If you find an error with iDaVIE (e.g., the program crashing, data not loading, or incorrect behaviour), `check if a similar issue already exists <https://github.com/idia-astro/iDaVIE/issues>`_. If a relevant issue does not exist already, create a new issue using one of the `relevant templates <https://github.com/idia-astro/iDaVIE/issues/new/choose>`_.

**Request a feature**

If you have an idea for a new feature you feel is missing from iDaVIE, feel free to open a new issue using the feature request `template <https://github.com/idia-astro/iDaVIE/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFR%5D+%22New+Feature+Request%22>`_. The development team will evaluate its feasibility, and assign it a priority depending on the likely difficulty of implementing it. Of course, nothing prevents you from adding the feature yourself.

Pull Request
------------
**Fixing an issue**

If you would like to add a feature or fix a bug yourself, feel free to look through our `existing issues <https://github.com/idia-astro/iDaVIE/issues>`_ to find one that interests you. You can filter the issues by `Label`, and we recommend issues labeled with `"good first issue" <https://github.com/idia-astro/iDaVIE/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_ for developers just getting started with iDaVIE. If you have selected an issue to work on, please leave a comment on the issue saying that you've claimed it, allowing the maintainers to follow up, keep track of what is being fixed, and prioritise. Once you complete your work, please open a pull request following the `pull request template <https://github.com/idia-astro/iDaVIE/compare>`_ and we'll integrate your fix into future releases of iDaVIE.

**Pull request etiquette**

#. Make sure to test a compiled version of the program before submitting a pull request, not just the version in the Unity Editor.
#. Make sure to add documentation in the code that you wrote – we will not accept pull requests that lack documentation.
#. Make sure to clearly list the changes you've made and why – detailed reasoning make it more likely that the pull request will be accepted.
