Introduction
============
.. note:: The current version of the software is in beta testing so please be aware that issues might arise. We also appreciate your collaboration in identifying them and, if you do, please post them in the issues page on `Github <https://github.com/idia-astro/idavie_releases/issues>`_. All issues will be fixed for the first data release. 

The mission of iDaVIE-v
-----------------------
iDaVIE-v is part of the iDaVIE software suite which is under development at `IDIA <https://www.idia.ac.za>`_. The DaVIE-v application has been developed in collaboration with `INAF-OACT <https://www.oact.inaf.it>`_ . The specific goal of iDaVIE-v is to enable the interrogation of data cubes using Virtual Reality Technology. For more details about the iDaVIE software suite development and all its aspects please refere to `Jarrett et al. 2021 (in press.) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201210342J/abstract>`_.

Codebase and releases
---------------------
iDavIE-v is an open-source project. Its source code will be made available after the Beta testing is concluded. 

Installation guides are provided in the section :ref:`installation_configuration`, including the installation of the needed VR environment.

The release plan and major goals are the following:

* v1.0-Beta.0: complete software only in executable format (released on 18th March 2021)
* v1.0-Beta.1: fixed deployment DLL bug (released on 29th March 2021
* v1.0-Beta.2: fixed loading frequency-based cubes issue (released on 10th April 2021)
* **v1.0-Beta.3 (current release)**: added ability to load and interact with large catalgoue (released on 7th July 2021)
* v1.0: complete software and source code (release date TBC)
