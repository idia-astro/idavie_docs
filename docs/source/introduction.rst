Introduction
============
.. note:: The current version of the software is in beta testing so please be aware that issues might arise. We also appreciate your collaboration in identifying them and, if you do, please post them in the issues page on `Github <https://github.com/idia-astro/idavie_releases/issues>`_. All issues will be fixed for the first data release. 

The mission of iDaVIE
-----------------------
iDaVIE is part of the iDaVIE software suite which is under development at `IDIA <https://www.idia.ac.za>`_. The DaVIE-v application has been developed in collaboration with `INAF-OACT <https://www.oact.inaf.it>`_ . The specific goal of iDaVIE is to enable the interrogation of data cubes using Virtual Reality Technology. For more details about the iDaVIE software suite development and all its aspects please refere to `Jarrett et al. 2021 (in press.) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201210342J/abstract>`_.

Codebase and releases
---------------------
iDavIE-v is an open-source project. Its source code is available on the project's GitHub `repository <https://github.com/idia-astro/iDaVIE/>`_. 

Installation guides are provided in the section :ref:`installation_configuration`, including the installation of the required VR environment.

If you want to build iDaVIE from source, please see :ref:`build`.
