System requirements
===================

Hardware
--------
In order to run the software, a system capable of running SteamVR is required. The system requirements are given on the `SteamVR store page <https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/>`_. We recommend at least an NVIDIA GTX 1070 or above, or the equivalent AMD GPU.

A quad-core or higher CPU is recommended. At least 8 GB of RAM is required. However, the size of the data cubes usable will depend heavily on system memory capacity. We recommend 16 GB, or 32 GB to support large data cubes.

Any VR headset compatible with SteamVR should function. The following VR headsets have been tested:

* Meta Rift
* Meta Rift S
* Meta Quest 2
* HTC Vive
* HTC Vive Pro
* Valve Index
* Samsung Odyssey

.. Tip:: In the IDIA Visualisation Lab we use the Valve Index (with wall-mounted sensors), while on the road we use Alienware gpu-powered laptops and the Meta Rift S. 

Software
--------
In order to run iDaVIE-v the following software needs to be installed:

#. Windows 10 (version 1903 or newer) is required.
#. The SteamVR runtime is required. Note t  hat in order to start SteamVR, some headsets (e.g. Meta headsets) require additional software to be installed. Instruction should be provided on the headsets webpage.
#. The latest 64-bit (X64) `Visual C++ redistributable <https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe>`_ needs to be installed.
