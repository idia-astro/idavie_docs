System requirements
===================

Hardware
--------
In order to run the software, a system capable of running SteamVR is required. The system requirements are given on the `SteamVR store page <https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/>`_.

iDaVIE requires at least an NVIDIA GTX 1080, or an AMD RX 5700 XT, or above. For full performance, we recommend an NVIDIA RTX 3080 or AMD RX 6800 XT GPU or newer.

A quad-core or higher CPU is recommended. At least 16 GB of RAM is required. However, the size of the data cubes usable will depend heavily on system memory capacity. We recommend 32 GB, or 64 GB to support large data cubes.

Any VR headset compatible with SteamVR should function. The following VR headsets are recommended (**tested**):

* **Meta Rift S**
* **Meta Quest 2**
* **Meta Quest 3**
* HTC Vive
* HTC Vive Pro
* Valve Index
* Samsung Odyssey

.. Note:: All of these headsets should work, but you might have to change the control bindings in the SteamVR interface.

.. Tip:: In the IDIA Visualisation Lab we use the Meta Quest 2 and the Meta Rift S headsets, with a dedicated machine in the lab and GPU-powered laptops while on the road. 

Software
--------
In order to run iDaVIE-v the following software needs to be installed:

#. Windows 10 (version 1903 or newer) is required.
#. The SteamVR runtime is required. Note that in order to start SteamVR, some headsets (e.g., Meta headsets) require additional software to be installed. Instructions should be provided with the headset's webpage.
#. The latest 64-bit (X64) `Visual C++ redistributable <https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe>`_ needs to be installed.
